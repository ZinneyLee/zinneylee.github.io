# Let's study about Data Science!

Hello, my name is Jane Lee.  
This is my HOMEPAGE! And I'm trying to share my **Knowledge** about *Data Science*.  
Then,,, Let's join!  

## ROC curve

First at all, I want to talk about **"ROC curve".**   
It's an indicator that evaluates AI that we made.  


### CONFUSION MATRIX  
Do you ever heard about **CONFUSION MATRIX**?  
It is the evaluation table and consist of TP, FP, TN and FN.  
Before we begin to study the confusion matrix in earnest, e need to know what "TP, FP, TN, FN" is.  
Suppose AI you made. And it predicts the result in binary(Positive or Negative).  
#### If real answer is "*POSITIVE*" about some problem.
- Our AI predicted the result to *POSITIVE*.
  - That time, We call it "True Positive(TP)".
- Our AI predicted the result to *NEGATIVE*
  - That time, We call it "False Negative(FN)".
#### If real answer is "*NEGATIVE*" about some problem.
- Our AI predicted the result to *POSITIVE*.
  - That time, We call it "False Positive(FP)".
- Our AI predicted the result to *NEGATIVE*
  - That time, We call it "True Negative(TN)".

Then we will make CONFUSION MATRIX!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZinneyLee/Zinney-Lee.github.oi/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
